# Project Progress

## Overview

CDISC Biomedical Concept Curation — a Flask/Jinja web application for curating, governing, and exporting CDISC Biomedical Concepts (BCs) and Data Element Concepts (DECs). Current phase: **MVP Complete / Initial Build**.

- ✅ Created `models/bc.py` — `BiomedicalConcept` + `DataElementConcept` SQLAlchemy models
- ✅ Created `models/specialization.py` — `DatasetSpecialization` model
- ✅ Created `models/governance.py` — `GovernanceRecord` model (4-stage Kanban)
- ✅ Created `models/audit.py` — `AuditLog` model
- ✅ Created `models/ingestion.py` — `IngestionRecord` model (DB-backed session storage)
- ✅ Created `routes/dashboard.py` — Dashboard with KPI stats
- ✅ Created `routes/ingestion.py` — File upload + parse queue + approve/reject flow
